Communication overhead - model-1
----------------------------------
The overall communication cost of the servers given by:
(2 × N × | Ws |) × T + N × | Ws |
N is the size of the trained model in bytes
| Ws | is the number of selected workers
T is the total number of training rounds
here,
T = 10 
N = 196096 bytes
Ws=1272
communication cost = 5.23 GB
